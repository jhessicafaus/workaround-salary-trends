# WorKAround Salary Trends

For this Codecademy practice, the task was assisting WorkAround, a fictitious company that provides data on salary trends in the tech industry, to create a new application to make their data viewable. 
Importing / exporting JavaScript ES modules are used to accomplish this.

## Objective
The WorkAround web app should allow users to choose specific roles and companies in the tech industry and view the following information:

* The salary for the chosen role at the chosen company.
* The industry average for the chosen role.
* The average salary at the chosen company across all roles.
* The industry average salary across all roles and all companies.
